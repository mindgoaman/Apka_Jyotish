App:

- Notifications still go back to November

- When clicking add property, "3790 Via De NOIDA" is showing as address for all caravans

- Address doesn't work in my profile account to show business address

- detail text box is not showing on any caravan

- Random alerts stating: "undefined is not an object (evaluating't.message')" - When this comes up, app stops functioning

- Our Contact us page only should have our email address to reach out. No phone number or physical address.

- Is there a note text box for users when viewing the caravan properties? I am unable to see this until the properties are showing.

- When looking at the caravan home page, you should be able to click on the address under caravan name to direct you to the caravan. Right now you can only click on email address for the caravan admin.

- Also, I cannot find any addresses to see if the map is working or not.  The properties that were approved are not showing anywhere either.

- Cant tell if "Favorites" works without addresses being shown either since we cannot favorite any houses.
